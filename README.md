# In this Banking Model,with the implementation of different strategies followed in the bank with respective to the features such as education,job,age ,month etc,we would be able to predict the datas on regular basis.Here,there are 17 features and few of them are taken into consideration.However the datas are encoded to the numerical values since the samples provided in the word format cannot be implemented in the Binary classification.The creation of distribution graph ,scatter and density plot,correlation matrix and Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification,the accuracy drops slightly from 89% to 88% and 85% with respective to the increase in the datas provided in three dataset.Overall with the 17 features and by choosing the top 3 datasets,the accuracy level is overall 84%. The top 5 correlating features didn't make much difference in accuracy comparitively to Top 3 because the words are repititve.However,the top 10 features makes a vast difference in accuracy as the new words are quite different from each other.Next with the KMeans, EM Algorithm, Elbow, Siloutte method and by testing and training with the dataset.By testing with 30% and 60% in each and every training and test set,the datas do not overfits and the accuracy in the training sets is higher than that of the test sets.Here,rather than using the linear Regression,the logistic regression has been implemented as in this data set the all the datas collected as input are transferred to the hidden cells and executed as output as 2 class as it is binary.Moreover,accuracy of the Multi layer Perceptron and logistic Regression does not have vast difference, and so the model overfits.
